# The Card Editor #

On the exploration editor page, you will see a graph of interlinked cards. Clicking on any of these cards takes you to the card editor page, which will look something like this:

This page consists of four parts:<br>
<br>
<ul><li><a href='Parameters.md'>Parameter changes</a>
</li><li><a href='NonInteractiveContent.md'>Non-interactive content</a>
</li><li><a href='InteractiveWidgets.md'>Interactions</a>
</li><li><a href='Rules.md'>Rules</a></li></ul>

Each of the above links describes the corresponding part in more detail.<br>
<br>
The page may also contain statistics about the card. For example, in the screenshot above, we can see a to-do list containing the responses that hit the 'default rule'. If a particular answer appears in this list multiple times, it suggests that writing a separate, more targeted rule for it might be a good idea. You can remove the response from the list at any time by clicking the corresponding 'Delete' text on the right-hand side.
